          <h2>Who are we?</h2>
          <p id="text2" >We are the Local Loser's Movie Club! 
            A small group of friends, with a big passion for watching movies and an even bigger passion for talking about them. 
            It all began in the corridors of our university, where we, the founding losers (Lisa, Tindra and Rebecca) filled the breaks between lectures with intense, often chaotic, movie-related discussions. 
            Lisa, the resident movie expert (she does work at the cinema, after all), always had the sharpest takes. Tindra, the artist of the group, caught every little detail most of us missed. And Rebecca... well, she’s seen maybe five movies in total and still can’t give a rating to save her life, but she's here for the vibes.  
            To keep track of our cinematic adventures, and our strong opinions (*cough* Lisa *cough*), especially during school holidays when we saw each other less, we started looking for a digital platform to host it all. But every existing movie review website felt wrong...too many movies, too many strangers, too many distractions. We just wanted a platform to talk about the stuff we cared about with the people we cared about. 
            So, we decided to build our own.  
            Soon, we started to invite others to join the madness, and just like that the Local Loser’s Movie Club was born. A place where movie nerds are free to say whatever unhinged thing they want, about whatever they just watched. </p>

          <h3>Our Mission </h3>
          <p id="text3" >We built the Local Loser’s Movie Club website to keep things simple. 
            Only the movies we actually care about. Only the reviews we actually want to read. 
            No more endless scrolling through lists of titles you’ve never heard of. No need to log in, reset your password, or verify your email. Just pick a fun nickname, say what you think, and you’re done. 
            Whether you're all about the latest blockbuster or obsessed with some weird indie film that played once in a basement in Berlin, we got room for you. 
            Maybe your Letterboxd is full of “cool director” names, but you secretly love Sharknado? That’s fine. You’re one of us. </p>
